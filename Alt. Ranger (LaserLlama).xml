</autolevel><autolevel level="2" ><slots>0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,</slots><feature><name>Spellcasting</name><text>At 2nd level, you learn to draw upon the primal magic of the natural world to enhance your survival and combat skills: 

Preparing and Casting Spells:
The Ranger table above shows how many spell slots you have to cast spells. To cast a Ranger spell of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all of your expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
At the end of each long rest, you prepare a list of spells that are available for you to cast. Choose a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your Ranger level, rounded down. Spells must all be from the Ranger spell list at the end of this class, and be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

Spellcasting Ability:
Your power is drawn from an intuitive knowledge of nature, so Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for Ranger spells. You use Wisdom when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, your Spell save DC, or when you make a spell attack roll. 

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use a druidic focus as the spellcasting focus for your Ranger spells. See the Player&#39;s Handbook for example foci.

Ritual Casting:
Your knowledge of the natural world allows you to draw out its innate magic. You can cast any Ranger spell that you have prepared as a ritual so long as that spell has the ritual tag.</text></feature>
<feature><name>Ranger&#39;s Quarry</name><text>You focus your senses to hunt as a predator of the wild. Also at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action to mark one creature you can see as your Quarry, gaining the benefits below: 

Whenever you deal damage to it, you deal bonus damage equal to one roll of your Quarry Die, which is a d4. 

Whenever you make an ability check to track or locate it, you can add one roll of your Quarry Die to your d20 roll. 

These benefits last for 1 hour but end early if your Quarry is slain or if you mark another creature as your Quarry. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend a spell slot to use this feature again. 
When you reach 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels in this class, both the duration of Ranger&#39;s Quarry and the size of your Quarry Die increase, as indicated in the Ranger table.</text></feature>
